                <h2>Adoption Process</h2>
                <p>We are excited that you're considering adopting a pet! Here's how the process works:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Browse Available Pets</strong> – Visit our <a href="available-pets.html">Available Pets</a> page and explore the wonderful pets waiting for a home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Choose Your Pet</strong> – Select a pet that you feel would be a good fit for your family and lifestyle. Make sure to read their profile and consider factors like age, breed, and temperament.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: Fill Out an Adoption Application</strong> – Complete our online adoption application form. This helps us learn more about your home environment and your experience with pets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: Meet & Greet</strong> – After reviewing your application, we will arrange a meet-and-greet with the pet to ensure it’s a good fit. This will allow you to interact with the pet and see how you connect.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 5: Home Visit (if needed)</strong> – In some cases, we may conduct a home visit to make sure it's a safe and welcoming environment for your new pet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 6: Adoption Approval</strong> – Once everything is confirmed, we will approve your adoption! We’ll guide you on how to prepare for bringing your new pet home.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 7: Bring Your Pet Home</strong> – After adoption approval, you can bring your pet home. We will provide guidance on settling them in, including any necessary supplies, vaccinations, and other essentials.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We are committed to helping you every step of the way to ensure a smooth transition for both you and your new pet.</p>
